         <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
         <p>Hello,</p>
         <p>Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
         <p>My name is Lorraine Wambui Wambiru. I have gone through Primary School at Roots Academy and High school at Pangani Girls School. I have furthered my education to do short courses over my newly found love for technology at Institute of Advanced Technology (IAT), where I learnt Level 1 web design, which include HTML and CSS and also Software development at Moringa School, which include all the languages of programming. I expect to join The Kabarak University to pursue a career in Computer Science. I haven't had any job experience in this area of computer programming, but I have undertaken a job in Online Captioning which is also quite informative.</p>
         <p>I decided to take up a programming class because it is a field I would like to major on. It makes it so, that you actually see results, most times that not, that give you a great sense of achievement; no matter how small. So definitely Programming is my thing.</p>
